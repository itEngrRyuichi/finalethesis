## INTRODUCTION

### Overview of the Current State

The Department of Education is responsible in managing and governing the basic educational system in the country. It is the chief formulator of the country’s primary and secondary school system. The former educational system of the Philippines was composed of six years of elementary education and four years of high school education starting at the age of 12. With this system, compulsory education is not enforced.

However, on June 4, 2012, the Department of Education implemented a new educational system which is the K-12 educational system that includes new curriculum. This new educational system is compulsory for all private and public schools. All private and public schools in the Philippines must start classes managed 200-day school calendar of Department of Education. Senior High School (SHS) refers to Grades 11 and 12, the last two years of the K-12 program that Department of Education has been implementing since 2012. Students begin to study in Senior High School the subjects that will introduce them to their preferred career path.

Since technology is changing the methods through which education is delivered, schools are confronting formations which affect the nature of the courses and degree program they offer. These technological innovations have also driven the growth of distance learning opportunities. Students who have personal responsibilities, physical disabilities and time-bound due to geographic location can now access the courses and degree program at their convenience.

The current system of Senior High School Department gives quizzes and exams both written and online. For the online quizzes and exams, there is currently no system being developed exclusively for them. In their current state, the Senior High School Director does not have soft copy of final grades of students. When distributing learning materials, a hand-out is given to a certain student and being passed to their classmates. Students also have the means to alter their grades before fiving it to their parents.

### Desire State of Technology

The study desire to create and develop a Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System. A program that will be exclusively made for the Senior High School department to be mainly used by Senior High School Director, teacher, students as well as their parents. This program will be able to facilitate the students in tracking their lesson plans and give an easy access for the learning materials needed in studying. This program shall be made in a systematized manner to ensure that teachers will not have difficulty in using it, a user manual shall also be provided.
The compulsory grading system of the Department of Education for the Senior High School shall also be implemented when making an automated grade for each student.

### Statement of the Problem

During analysis, the proponent was able to note the following:

1.	Lesson plan for every subject and manually given which the students might either misplace or have lost it
2.	There is difficulty in distributing learning materials to the students namely slides and word documents because of certain limit like passing of the files from one student to the other.
3.	The current system being used in taking quizzes and exams online was not made exclusively fir the Senior High School Department.
4.	There is difficulty in providing the parents the current grades per grading period and number of absences of their children because it is not all the time that they will be able to go to school especially for personal reasons.
5.	The current system does not provide copy of final grades of students.


### Objectives of the Study

### Theoretical Framework

<img src="./Theoretical Framework Diagram.png">(Figure 1.0 Theoretical Framework Diagram)

Figure 1.0 shows the diagram of the theoretical framework for the development of the Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System. This system shall be given quality assurance to ensure that there will be no inconsistency in maintaining the important factors by which the system is involved. Multiple software testing and further evaluations shall be accomplished and to determine that the objectives of this study will be implemented. Strict maintenance shall be imposed by doing necessary alterations if needed.

**Input**. Input shows the features to be benefitted by all intended users of the system which are the Admin, Students, Teachers and Parents. Each user has their own set of features. Access on each feature shall be circumscribed depending on the user who tries to access it.

**Process**. In order for input to be carried out, there is a process we should develop. In making a system, researchers should always conduct thorough research to collect the necessary data that are needed. Gathering these data is a major condition in this system. After analyzing these data, proper programming will be applied. During implementation, imposing strict maintenance shall be made for securing all data within the system.

**Output**. This is the part where the system is fully operational and ready to be enforced when process is achieved.

### Conceptual Framework

**Hosting Server**. The hosting server is composed of the system to be implemented. It will be accessed by intended users via online.

**Security**. This study includes security feature that provide a method of authentication. In this authentication system method, it allows the user to go through the login/logout services. It is a common method of authentication which allows only authorized users to access data, information, and control the functions of the system.

**Users**. 	The users which are mainly composed of the Admin, Students, Teachers and Parents are the ones who are going to have the benefit to make use of the system to be implemented.
RDBMS. RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is structured in database tables, fields and records. Each RDBMS table consists of database table rows. Each database table row consists of one or more database table fields. RDBMS store the data into collection of tables, which might be related by common fields. RDBMS also provide relational operators to manipulate the data stored into the database tables.

### Scope and Limitations

The system to be developed is intended for Central Philippine University Senior High School. The purpose of the system is to provide an exclusive learning management system for the department. The system will be used by the teachers to give online quizzes and exams as well as making lesson plans and uploading downloading learning materials to provide the students on what to study. For the students on the other hand, they will be able to use the system in takin online quizzes and exams, viewing the lesson plans and downloading the learning materials that they need. The system allows the parents to view the current grades and the number of absences of their children. The Senior High School director who will be made as the admin can manage all accounts along with checking the user and activity logs.


The system will only cover the subjects and area under the Senior High School department. The system can only be accessed with internet connection.

### Significance of the Study

The purpose of the system is to precisely monitor the performance of the students. The system can also give the parents an update of the current grading status and the number of absences made by their children. The class teacher can now view the final grades of students anytime.

**Students**. Their activities, quizzes, assignments, grades and performance will be kept in an orderly and organized manner. They can take the advantage of conveniences by being able to submit their requirements on the given time. They may also be able to download the modules necessary for their subjects, as such, they wouldn’t have to spend time photocopying or printing. Instead, they can view these learning materials in their phone, computer or tablet.

**Teachers**. It will be easy for them to handle the files of their students and their work will be much easy. It is also for the safety of their files because it will be done in a systematized manner and there will be back-up and security program.

**Parents**. It is easy for them to know the performance of their children through this system.


### System Overview

The Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System will be used as a tool in learning with the use of electronic technologies. The System is intended to be used for giving online quizzes and exams to the students. Since it can be accessed anytime as long as there is an internet connection, the students can keep track of updates with regards to their studies. Due to e-learning system being cost-effective and save time, it will be beneficial for the teachers in crating quizzes, exams, and lesson plans to be given to the students. It will also be used for the parents in checking the status of their children even when they do not have time to come school for personal reasons.

The management of data in the system will require an authorized user account identification. The accounts will be used by the admin, teachers, students, and parents. Each account will provide different authorization using their desired username and password and each of this account has their own set features to be accessed. The system will be managed by admin account which will be used by the Senior High School Director. The admin account will have all the privileges in viewing, updating and removing existing date if needed.

### Summary

eLearning is learning utilizing electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside of traditional classroom. In most cases, it refers to a course, program or degree delivered completely online. In the early days, some people were concerned that bringing computers into the classroom would remove the human element that many learners benefit from. But technology has developed and are now widely embraced in both the classroom and office. I also use a wealth of interactive design that ensure distance learning is both an engaging and valuable lesson delivery medium.

The main purpose of this study is to create an eLearning system for the Central Philippine University Senior High School. Once this system is implemented, it will be able to solve the problems encountered in the current system and make positive changes to it. The system contains features that are basically needed by the intended users.
