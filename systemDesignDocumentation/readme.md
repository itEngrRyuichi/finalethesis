## INTRODUCTION

### Overview of the Current State

The Department of Education is responsible in managing and governing the basic educational system in the country. It is the chief formulator of the country’s primary and secondary school system. The former educational system of the Philippines was composed of six years of elementary education and four years of high school education starting at the age of 12. With this system, compulsory education is not enforced.

However, on June 4, 2012, the Department of Education implemented a new educational system which is the K-12 educational system that includes new curriculum. This new educational system is compulsory for all private and public schools. All private and public schools in the Philippines must start classes managed 200-day school calendar of Department of Education. Senior High School (SHS) refers to Grades 11 and 12, the last two years of the K-12 program that Department of Education has been implementing since 2012. Students begin to study in Senior High School the subjects that will introduce them to their preferred career path.

Since technology is changing the methods through which education is delivered, schools are confronting formations which affect the nature of the courses and degree program they offer. These technological innovations have also driven the growth of distance learning opportunities. Students who have personal responsibilities, physical disabilities and time-bound due to geographic location can now access the courses and degree program at their convenience.

The current system of Senior High School Department gives quizzes and exams both written and online. For the online quizzes and exams, there is currently no system being developed exclusively for them. In their current state, the Senior High School Director does not have soft copy of final grades of students. When distributing learning materials, a hand-out is given to a certain student and being passed to their classmates. Students also have the means to alter their grades before fiving it to their parents.

### Desire State of Technology

The study desire to create and develop a Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System. A program that will be exclusively made for the Senior High School department to be mainly used by Senior High School Director, teacher, students as well as their parents. This program will be able to facilitate the students in tracking their lesson plans and give an easy access for the learning materials needed in studying. This program shall be made in a systematized manner to ensure that teachers will not have difficulty in using it, a user manual shall also be provided.
The compulsory grading system of the Department of Education for the Senior High School shall also be implemented when making an automated grade for each student.
