## INTRODUCTION

### Overview of the Current State

Not long ago, the concept of senior high school was a blur. High school only lasted for four years and before that, most schools had only six or seven years for grade school. Since the implementation of the K-12 system in the Philippines, the whole pre-university educational system had changed. What used to be only ten years of studying has now become twelve, with the two additional years now being referred to as ‘Senior High School’ or SHS. This new educational system is compulsory for all private and public schools. All private and public schools in the Philippines must start the classes that manages 200-day school calendar of the Department of Education. Senior High School (SHS) refers to Grades 11 and 12, the last two years of the K-12 program that the Department of Education has implemented since 2012. Students begin to study at Senior High School the subjects that will introduce them to their preferred career path.

Since technology is changing the methods through which education is delivered, schools are confronting formations which affect the nature of the courses and degree program they offer. These innovations have also driven the growth of opportunities for distance learning. Students who are time-bound due to geographic location, have personal responsibilities, and physical disabilities can now access the courses and degree programs at their convenience. 

The current system of the Senior High School department gives out quizzes and exams both written and online. For the online quizzes and exams, there is currently no system being developed exclusively. In their current state, the Senior High School Director does not have a soft copy of the final grades of the students. When distributing learning materials, a hand-out is given to a student representative and being passed on to their classmates. Students also have the means to alter their grades before giving it to their parents.

### Desire State of Technology

The study desire to create and develop a Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System. A program that will be exclusively made for the Senior High School department to be mainly used by Senior High School Director, teacher, students as well as their parents. This program will be able to facilitate the students in tracking their lesson plans and give an easy access for the learning materials needed in studying. This program shall be made in a systematized manner to ensure that teachers will not have difficulty in using it, a user manual shall also be provided.
The compulsory grading system of the Department of Education for the Senior High School shall also be implemented when making an automated grade for each student.

### Statement of the Problem

During analysis, the proponent was able to note the following:

1.	Lesson plan for every subject and manually given which the students might either misplace or have lost it
2.	There is difficulty in distributing learning materials to the students namely slides and word documents because of certain limit like passing of the files from one student to the other.
3.	The current system being used in taking quizzes and exams online was not made exclusively fir the Senior High School Department.
4.	There is difficulty in providing the parents the current grades per grading period and number of absences of their children because it is not all the time that they will be able to go to school especially for personal reasons.
5.	The current system does not provide copy of final grades of students.


### Objectives of the Study

General Objective:
This study aims to design and develop a Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System.

### Specific Objective:

### Theoretical Framework

<img src="./Theoretical Framework Diagram1.png">(Figure 1.0 Theoretical Framework Diagram)

Figure 1.0 shows the holistic theoretical framework for the development of the Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System. The holistic theoretical framework was constructed upon the three main components of an information system: people, technology, and services provided by technology itself. Guided by these main pillars we revise and identify the users and their interaction with the system. We then present the classification of the technological considerations to these kinds of system, focusing more on the contents type and ways of communication, than on providing a list of the platforms existing.


**Software**. Different front-end and back-end software will be used in creating the system. Front-end or the client-side is the design part of the system where the users interact directly. The proposed languages to be used on the front-end are HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, SASS, Node.js, VUE.js, and NPM. Back-end or the server-side handles the functionality of the system. It focuses in making updates and necessary changes to enhance security. The languages to be used for the back-end are PHP7, Laravel, Composer, MySQL, and XAMPP.

**Features**.  The features are the primary objectives of the system that must be performed and delivered by the intended users. Each user has their own set of features. Access on each features shall be circumscribed depending on the user who tries to access it. 

The following are the features included in the system:
- Login - The authorization method used by the system which the user shall input their registered unique email and password.
- Generate Access Code - An access code will be generated automatically to be used whenever a student enrolls in a certain subject.
- View Account Details – Allows users to check their account settings.
- Account Lists - Shows all the accounts registered. The admin can view and delete teacher accounts while the teachers can view and delete student accounts.
- Accept Accounts - An admin and teacher function in accepting accounts that register in the system.
- Section Catalog - List all the sections of Senior High School department.
- Classmate - Classmate function allows the students to view the names of their classmates in every section.
- Subject Catalog - Allows the students and teachers to view the subject enrolled.
- Enrollment - The Enrollment function allows the students to enroll on their respective subjects after being created by the teacher.
- Dashboard - The Dashboard allows the students to view all their ongoing classes for the semester and the classes completed.
- View Class - The View Class function allows the students to view the class they have enrolled.
- Lessons - List of the lesson plans handed out by the teachers for each subject.
- Tasks - This function allows the teachers to create all activities – written work, performance task, and quarterly assessment.
- Class Online Quiz - used by the students when taking an online quiz.
- Class Resource - The Class Resource function allows the teachers to upload learning materials for the students to view or download. A resource material can only be viewed or downloaded on its designated subject.
- Attendance - A system function used by the teachers in checking the student attendance in every class. This function can also be viewed by the students and parents.
- Grading - A system function where the students and parents may view the grades for every class.
- Private Resource - A system function that students use in uploading resource materials on their accounts.
- Generate Online Quiz - A system function used by the teachers when giving online quizzes to the students.

**Users**. The users are the people who are going to use the system, namely the Admin, Teachers, Students, and Parents.

**Process**. In order for the system to be carried out, there is a process to be developed. In making the system, researchers should conduct a thorough research to collect the necessary data that are needed. Gathering these data is a major condition in this system. After analyzing these data, proper programming will be applied. During implementation, imposing strict maintenance shall be made for securing all data within the system.




### Conceptual Framework

<img src="./Conceptual Framework Diagram1.png">(Figure 2.0 Conceptual Framework Diagram)

Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System. Our group have applied the design of the system according to the conceptual framework.
A conceptual framework is a diagram that visually represents and interprets the underlying theory, principles, and concepts of a research. It is a visual presentation of variables that interrelate with one another as perceived by the researchers before an actual empirical investigation is done to prove its relationship. This consists of concepts that are placed within a logical and sequential design. It represents the less formal structure and used for studies in which existing theory is inapplicable or insufficient. It is based on specific concepts and propositions, derived from empirical observation and intuition. The purpose of the conceptual framework is to clarify concepts and propose relationships among the concepts in a study. It is used to provide a context for interpreting the study findings, to explain observations, and to encourage theory development that is useful to practice.


**Hosting Server**. The hosting server is composed of the system to be implemented. It will be accessed by intended users via online.

**Security**. This study includes security feature that provide a method of authentication. In this authentication system method, it allows the user to go through the login/logout services. It is a common method of authentication which allows only authorized users to access data, information, and control the functions of the system.

**Users**. 	The users which are mainly composed of the Admin, Students, Teachers and Parents are the ones who are going to have the benefit to make use of the system to be implemented.
RDBMS. RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is structured in database tables, fields and records. Each RDBMS table consists of database table rows. Each database table row consists of one or more database table fields. RDBMS store the data into collection of tables, which might be related by common fields. RDBMS also provide relational operators to manipulate the data stored into the database tables.

### Scope and Limitations

The system to be developed is intended for Central Philippine University Senior High School. The purpose of the system is to provide an exclusive learning management system for the department. The system will be used by the teachers to give online quizzes and exams as well as making lesson plans and uploading downloading learning materials to provide the students on what to study. For the students on the other hand, they will be able to use the system in takin online quizzes and exams, viewing the lesson plans and downloading the learning materials that they need. The system allows the parents to view the current grades and the number of absences of their children. The Senior High School director who will be made as the admin can manage all accounts along with checking the user and activity logs.


The system will only cover the subjects and area under the Senior High School department. The system can only be accessed with internet connection.

### Significance of the Study

The purpose of the system is to precisely monitor the performance of the students. The system can also give the parents an update of the current grading status and the number of absences made by their children. The class teacher can now view the final grades of students anytime.

**Students**. Their activities, quizzes, assignments, grades and performance will be kept in an orderly and organized manner. They can take the advantage of conveniences by being able to submit their requirements on the given time. They may also be able to download the modules necessary for their subjects, as such, they wouldn’t have to spend time photocopying or printing. Instead, they can view these learning materials in their phone, computer or tablet.

**Teachers**. It will be easy for them to handle the files of their students and their work will be much easy. It is also for the safety of their files because it will be done in a systematized manner and there will be back-up and security program.

**Parents**. It is easy for them to know the performance of their children through this system.


### System Overview

The Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System will be used as a tool in learning with the use of electronic technologies. The system is intended to be used for giving online quizzes and exams to the students. Since it can be accessed anytime as long as there is an internet connection, the students can keep track of updates with regards to their studies. Due to e-learning system being cost-effective and save time, it will be beneficial for the teachers in creating quizzes, exams, and lesson plans to be given to the students. It will also be used by the parents in checking the status of their children especially when they do not have time to come to school for personal reasons.

The management of data in the system will require an authorized user account identification. The accounts will be used by the admin, teachers, students, and parents. Each account will provide different authorization using their desired username and password and each of this account has their own set features to be accessed. The system will be managed by an admin which is the Senior High School Director. The admin account will have the privileges in accepting teacher accounts and viewing of grades.


### System Objectives

1.	To allow the Senior high School Director to manage all data in the system which includes viewing, uploading and removing existing data.
2.	To allow the teachers to create lesson plans in order for the students to keep track of what to study.
3.	To allow the teachers to upload learning materials to be downloaded by the students to help them in their learning.
4.	To allow the teachers to create online quizzes and exams to be given to the students whenever available.
5.	To allow the parents to check for the current grading status and number of absences of their children

### Physical Environment.  
The tables below are the hardware and software specifications of the system.

### Hardware Specification
<img src="./Server-Side and Client-Side Hardware Specification Table.png">(Table 2.0 Server-Side and Client-Side Hardware Specification Table)

The table shown above is the minimum system requirements for the server and client when running the system.

### Software Specification
<img src="./Software Specification Table.png">(Table 3.0 Software Specification Table)

**Operating System: Windows 10 Home**
Windows 10 is a Microsoft operating system for personal computers, tablets, embedded devices and internet of things devices. Microsoft released Windows 10 in July 2015 as a follow-up to Windows 8. The company has said it will update Windows 10 in perpetuity rather than release a new, full-fledged operating system as a successor.

**Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML5)**
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for creating a webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can display them correctly. HTML can also be used to add meta information to a webpage. 

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3)** 
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS.

**JavaScript (JS)**
JavaScript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the pages to react to events, exhibit special effects, accept variable text, validate data, create cookies, detect a user’s browser, etc.

**jQuery**
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code. jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

**Bootstrap**
Bootstrap is a free and open source front end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps. The Bootstrap framework is built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) to facilitate the development of responsive, mobile-first sites and apps.

**Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets (SASS)**
Sass (which stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is an extension to CSS. It doesn't really change what CSS can do, you won't suddenly be able to use Adobe Photoshop blend modes or anything-but it makes writing CSS a whole lot easier. Sass includes various features such as variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, built-in functions to manipulate color and other values, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.

**Node.js**
Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.

**VUE.js**
Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

**NPM**
NPM, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. A plethora of Node.js libraries and applications are published on npm, and many more are added every day.

**Hypertext Processor (PHP7)**
PHP is a server side scripting language. that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web applications. PHP stands for Hypertext Pre-processor, that earlier stood for Personal Home Pages. PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed. The client computers accessing the PHP scripts require a web browser only. A PHP file contains PHP tags and ends with the extension ".php".

**Laravel**
Laravel is one of the most popular PHP framework used across the globe to build web application ranging from small to big projects. Laravel is the choice of professional developers because of its performance, features, and scalability. Laravel follows MVC (Model View Controller) structure which makes it easy to learn and rapidly prototype the web applications. Laravel takes the pain out of web application development by providing built-in features like authentication, mail, routing, sessions, and the list goes on.

**Composer**
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Composer will manage the dependencies you require on a project by project basis. This means that Composer will pull in all the required libraries, dependencies and manage them all in one place. This kind of management for dependencies in a project is not a new concept, and in fact, much of Composer is actually inspired from npm from Node.js and Bundler from Ruby.

**MySQL**
MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL – Structured Query Language. The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. The most common use for mySQL however, is for the purpose of a web database. It can be used to store anything from a single record of information to an entire inventory of available products for an online store. In association with a scripting language such as PHP or Perl it is possible to create websites which will interact in real-time with a mySQL database to rapidly display categorised and searchable information to a website user.

**XAMPP**
XAMPP is an open source software developed by Apache friends. XAMPP software package contains Apache distributions for Apache server, MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. And it is basically a local host or a local server. This local server works on your own desktop or laptop computer. The use of XAMPP is to test the clients or your website before uploading it to the remote web server. This XAMPP server software gives you the suitable environment for testing MYSQL, PHP, Apache and Perl projects on the local computer. The full form of XAMPP is X stands for Cross-platform, (A) Apache server, (M) MariaDB, (P) PHP and (P) Perl. The Cross-platform usually means that it can run on any computer with any operating system.

### Network Layout
<img src="./Network Layout.png">(Figure 4.0 Network Layout)

Figure 4.0 illustrates how the network is setup for the system. The system is an application program that can connect to the internet where it can be accessed by the users through it. Users can connect to the internet using a wired connection attached to a switch or directly connected to a router. The router is then connected to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) via DSL/Cable modem. 
The data submitted in the system will be stored in the database, which is directly connected to the server, which is also connected to the internet. By using the internet, the system can directly send and receive data for each activities made by a user. The users of the system which are the Admin, Student, Teacher, and Parent will need an internet connection to send and receive data from the server.

### Design and Implementation Issues
The system will mainly serve as an eLearning platform for Senior High School students. It is as user friendly as possible with menus and buttons that are well arranged and easier to navigate. The system is designed to store all subject information of students at the start of the deployment of the system. The system will lessen the workload of the teachers since all the grades will be computed automatically. It also includes a parent account which they can view their child’s grading status from time to time.

Although the system is designed to have convenient features for all intended users, it has its own drawbacks. For instance, an unstable network connection may cause some technical issues and can cause delay of submitting data.


## Summary

eLearning is learning utilizing electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside of traditional classroom. In most cases, it refers to a course, program or degree delivered completely online. In the early days, some people were concerned that bringing computers into the classroom would remove the human element that many learners benefit from. But technology has developed and are now widely embraced in both the classroom and office. I also use a wealth of interactive design that ensure distance learning is both an engaging and valuable lesson delivery medium.

The main purpose of this study is to create an eLearning system for the Central Philippine University Senior High School. Once this system is implemented, it will be able to solve the problems encountered in the current system and make positive changes to it. The system contains features that are basically needed by the intended users.

### Conclusion

The Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System was made to be exclusively used by the Senior High School department. The system will be used give students online quizzes and exams, an easier way to keep track of the lesson discussions for the subjects, lessen the hassle in having learning materials for the subjects and providing the parent and update of their children’s attendance and grading status.

The Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System meets all the objectives stated in this project. The system can do the following:

1.	Create Lesson Plans
2.	Create Online Quizzes and Exams
3.	Upload and download learning materials
4.	Provide the children’s grading status to their parents
5.	Class Teacher will have a copy of final grades of students

### Recommendations

The Web Based Central Philippine University Senior High School Class Management System was an effective system for the Senior High School department. The proponents were able to address the needs of the client which is the Senior High School Director. To make the system more effective, we recommend for the department and future researchers the following:

1.	An accounting system linked to the accounting office to save time in waiting in line just to check any remaining balance.
2.	A mobile web app support system in giving the users notifications through their mobile phones.
3.	A real-time collaboration of editing documents such as group activities using google spreadsheets or alike.
4.	A live chat application to be used as an alternative for social media websites.
5.	Make the system more dynamic especially with the section and class catalog.
